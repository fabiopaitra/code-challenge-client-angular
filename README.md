#### Improvements
- Remove deprecated atributes
- Use Services and Models
- Improve type usage
- Templates lighter with fewer computation and built in directives
- Light components controllers

#### Future suggestions
- Improve modeling
- Client branding styles 
- Comprehensive use of Observable instead of a settimeout
- Improve notification and alert messages
- Add a modal or a logic to to show the tendency of temperature
- Use of google analytics 
- Add possibilities to add more beers on the interface
- Add e2e tests

#### Approach
We have good oportunities in the backend, but a Annual Craft Beer Festival is approching and we short time we had, to objective is to improve the user experience.

#### Questions
- Is it ok to remove the texting and putting only the collors guide? We can build labels to make it clear.THe objective is to make more visual and less cluttered.
- How we receive data from sensors? Would be more efficient to change temperature and send them in only one request and only when it changes. 
- Do we store the information on a database? We could add some tendency temperatures.
